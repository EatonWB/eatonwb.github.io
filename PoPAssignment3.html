<h3><b><u>On my Way to Taiwan</u></b></h3>

<p1>The Summer of 2022 I spent in Taiwan. When I arrived at the U.S. airport and walked to my gate, there was a Mennonite man sitting just before the door leading into the airplane. I thought to myself, "what was a Mennonite man going to Taiwan for?" It turned out he had actually ended up at the wrong gate, but for a couple of minutes, I questioned my view of diversity: <i>it exists in so many ways.</i> The flight to Taipei was rough but certainly not unbearable. Yet somehow the woman sitting next to me never stood up once. Not to stretch, not to move around, nothing. She was still the entire flight. And the guy to my left was friendly! He was born in Taiwan but had been living in Hawaii for the past 28 years. All in all, the journey to Taiwan was not half as boring as I thought it would be walking into the airport that day.</p1>

<h3><b><u>The Highlight of my Trip</u></b></h3>

<p2>Two nights before I flew back to the U.S., my girlfriend and I went camping in the near-central region of Taiwan, where most of the mountains in the country run North to South. Because her birthday was only a week prior, two friends of hers invited us to camp for a fraction of the standard cost. We barbecued (the Taiwanese equivalent), cliff dove and sang KTV, short for "Karaoke Television." Sure, I had trips where I travelled to the most southern region of Taiwan and even went paragliding on the Eastern coast, but what I experienced in my two months had never become more apparent than in that moment. Not only was my time with my girlfriend that summer coming to an end, but everything I had done, everything I had accomplished, had also run its course. I cried. I laughed. It was surreal. It is the reason I am going back next year.</p2>
