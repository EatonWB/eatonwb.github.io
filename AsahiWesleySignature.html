        <h1 style="color: #0047AB;">American Food Culture</h1>
            <p>
                The culture of the food in the U.S. can best be described as undefined. With influences from the melting pot of nationalities<br>
                and cultures that make up the population, there are hundreds of various cuisines, each with their own unique flavors.<br><br>
                With that said, there are also foods that many would identify as "American," such as the hamburger and hotdog. Although how well<br>
                these foods are accepted in the international community compared to how well foreign foods are accepted in the United States<br>
                is another matter.<br><br>
                However, let's take a look at how two seemingly different cuisines—Japanese and American—and some recipes to go along with them,<br>
                delving into the commonalities between the two! Enjoy this culinary journey!
